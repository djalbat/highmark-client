## Introduction

Highmark is a document preparation system inspired by [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX).
There are several packages in the distribution.

- [Highmark-CLI](https://github.com/djalbat/highmark-cli) Highmark's CLI tool.
- [Highmark Yapp](https://github.com/djalbat/highmark-yapp) Highmark with Yapp listings.
- [Highmark Client](https://github.com/djalbat/highmark-client) Highmark's bundled client for viewing HTML.
- [Highmark Markdown](https://github.com/djalbat/highmark-markdown) Highmark's Markdown and Markdown Style languages.

Only the CLI tool is needed by end users.
All of the other packages are likely only of interest to prospective developers.

## Installation

If you would like to contribute or would simply like to have a look at the code, you can clone the repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/)...

    git clone https://github.com/djalbat/highmark-client.git

...and then install the dependencies with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) from within the project's root directory:

    npm install

## Example

Before starting you must find an `index.html` file generated by Highmark to serve.
If you have no alternative then generate one by cloning [The Occam User Manual](https://github.com/djalbat/the-occam-user-manual) repository and using the Highmark CLI Tool.
Along with the `index.html` file, the `image` and `font` folders are ignored in this repository.
So you can copy across the images from the aforementioned repository and also grab the fonts from the Highmark Fonts repository.
Links to the fonts and CLI tool are above in case you missed them.

There is a small development server that can be run from within the project's directory with the following command:

    npm start

The example will then be available at the following URL:

http://localhost:8888

The source for the example can be found in the `src/example.js` file and corresponding`src/example` folder. You are encouraged to try the example whilst reading what follows. You can rebuild it on the fly with the following command:

    npm run watch-debug

The development server will reload the page whenever you make changes.

One last thing to bear in mind is that this package is included by way of a relative rather than a package import. If you are importing it into your own application, however, you should use the standard package import.

## Building

Automation is done with [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), have a look at the `package.json` file. The pertinent commands are:

    npm run build-debug
    npm run watch-debug
